# Push Notification Analytics Project Brief

## Executive Summary

This project will build a comprehensive analytics system to quantify the impact ("lift") of push notifications on user activity within the Tradeblock platform. By comparing each recipient's activity in the 48 hours after receiving a push notification to their baseline activity over the previous 30 days, we will generate actionable insights about push notification effectiveness and inform strategic decisions about notification campaigns.

## Business Context

Push notifications are a critical user engagement tool for Tradeblock, but we currently lack systematic measurement of their effectiveness. This creates several strategic challenges:
- **Blind Optimization**: We cannot identify which notification strategies drive the most user engagement
- **Resource Allocation**: Without effectiveness data, we cannot optimize notification frequency or timing
- **User Experience**: We risk over-notifying users without understanding the engagement trade-offs
- **Growth Strategy**: We cannot leverage push notifications as a scalable growth lever without measurement

This analytics system will transform push notifications from a "spray and pray" tactic into a data-driven growth engine.

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build a robust analytics pipeline that measures the causal impact of push notifications on key user engagement metrics, providing clear lift calculations for each notification campaign.

### Success Metrics
- **Data Coverage**: Successfully analyze 95%+ of push notification recipients
- **Statistical Rigor**: Generate reliable lift calculations with confidence intervals
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify specific notification strategies that drive 20%+ engagement lift
- **Operational Efficiency**: Complete analysis within 24 hours of notification sends

### Business Impact Goals
- **Campaign Optimization**: Enable 30%+ improvement in notification effectiveness through data-driven iteration
- **User Segmentation**: Identify high-response user segments for targeted campaigns
- **Frequency Optimization**: Determine optimal notification cadence to maximize engagement without fatigue
- **Content Strategy**: Identify message types and formats that drive highest user action rates

## Technical Scope

### Data Sources
1. **Push Notification Records (Neon Tech Database)**
   - User ID of each recipient
   - Exact timestamp of notification send
   - Message content and campaign metadata
   - Delivery status and automation context

2. **User Activity Data (PostHog)**
   - Raw event data for all tracked user activities
   - Key metrics: sessions, product engagement, offer creation/acceptance
   - Event properties and user identification mapping

### Analytics Framework
**Baseline Period**: 30 days prior to push notification
**Impact Period**: 48 hours after push notification
**Metrics Analyzed**:
- Session frequency and duration
- Product engagement (`PDP add to closet`, `PDP add to wishlist`)
- Transaction activity (`Offer Created`, `Offer Accepted`)
- Platform engagement (`Trade machine clicked`)

### Output Requirements
For each push notification campaign:
- **Volume Metrics**: Total recipients, analysis coverage, data quality scores
- **Engagement Lift**: Raw and percentage lift for each key metric
- **Statistical Confidence**: Confidence intervals and significance testing
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Lift patterns by user characteristics or behavior
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for campaign optimization

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **API Rate Limits**: PostHog API throttling requires intelligent batching (max 1,000 users per request)
- **Data Volume**: Large user cohorts require efficient processing to avoid timeout issues
- **User ID Mapping**: Complex mapping between database user IDs and PostHog identifiers
- **Time Zone Handling**: Precise timestamp management across different time zones

### Data Quality Considerations
- **Missing Data**: Some users may have incomplete event history or unmappable identifiers
- **Attribution Windows**: 48-hour impact window may miss delayed effects or overlap with other campaigns
- **Baseline Stability**: Users with irregular usage patterns may have unreliable baselines
- **External Factors**: Other marketing activities or platform changes may influence activity

### Business Constraints
- **Privacy Compliance**: All analysis must respect user privacy and data handling policies
- **Resource Limitations**: Processing must be efficient to avoid overwhelming database or API resources
- **Operational Integration**: Results must integrate with existing campaign management workflows

## Success Criteria

### Technical Excellence
- **Data Pipeline Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for analytics processing
- **Processing Performance**: Complete analysis for 10,000+ user campaigns within 2 hours
- **Data Accuracy**: <1% error rate in user ID mapping and metric calculations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures, missing data, and edge cases

### Analytical Rigor
- **Statistical Validity**: Proper baseline calculation, confidence intervals, and significance testing
- **Completeness**: Analysis covers 95%+ of notification recipients with quality scoring
- **Granularity**: Results available at individual user, campaign, and aggregate levels
- **Actionability**: Clear identification of high-performing notification strategies

### Business Impact
- **Decision Support**: Analytics directly inform notification campaign decisions
- **ROI Measurement**: Clear quantification of notification effectiveness and improvement opportunities
- **Strategic Insights**: Identification of user segments and strategies for optimization
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduction in ineffective notification sends and improved user experience

## Timeline & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Database integration and push notification record extraction
- PostHog API integration and user ID mapping validation
- Core analytics pipeline development and testing

### Phase 2: Analytics Engine (Weeks 2-3)

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Risks
- **Incomplete Mapping**: Develop fallback strategies for unmappable user IDs
- **API Reliability**: Implement robust retry logic and error recovery
- **Processing Scale**: Design efficient batching to handle large datasets

### Business Risks
- **Analysis Accuracy**: Validate results against known campaign performance patterns
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure all data handling meets privacy requirements
- **Operational Disruption**: Minimize impact on existing database and API resources

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Implement monitoring and optimization for critical path operations
- **Integration Complexity**: Plan for edge cases in data source integration
- **Scalability Limits**: Design for growth in notification volume and user base

## Long-term Vision

This analytics system serves as the foundation for:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict notification effectiveness before sending
- **Real-time Optimization**: Dynamic notification strategies based on live user behavior
- **Advanced Segmentation**: Sophisticated user clustering for personalized notification strategies
- **Cross-channel Analysis**: Integration with other marketing channels for holistic campaign measurement

The project establishes Tradeblock's capability to make data-driven decisions about user engagement, transforming push notifications from a cost center into a measurable growth driver.
