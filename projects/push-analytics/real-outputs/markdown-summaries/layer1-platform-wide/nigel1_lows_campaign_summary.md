## Methodology & Data Quality

**Data Sources:**
- Database: `user_notifications` table (PUSH_CADENCE_DATABASE_URL)
- PostHog: Events API via distinct_id matching
- Time Windows: 14-day baseline vs 48-hour post-push

**Quality Metrics:**
- User ID Matching: Direct database user_id â†’ PostHog distinct_id
- Time Window Precision: ISO 8601 timestamps  
- Sample Coverage: 1.7% (1/60) users with measurable activity

**Statistical Limitations:**
- Small sample size with activity (n=1 user)
- Insufficient power for significance testing
- Results not generalizable without larger sample

## Strategic Implications

**Campaign Performance:**
- Layer 1 platform-wide push showed **negative engagement** in limited sample
- Possible explanations: (1) Users already engaged with drop, (2) Timing after market close, (3) Sample not representative

**Recommendations:**
1. **Scale Analysis**: Expand to full 22,648 recipient analysis for statistical power
2. **Compare Timing**: Analyze send time impact (3:04 PM on Friday)
3. **Layer Comparison**: Compare vs Layer 2/3 campaigns for context
4. **Baseline Extension**: Consider 30-day baseline for seasonal products

## Next Steps
- [ ] Scale to full campaign recipient analysis (22,648 users)
- [ ] Cross-reference with sales data from Tradeblock backend
- [ ] Compare against other Layer 1 campaigns for pattern identification
- [ ] Analyze user segmentation by engagement history
