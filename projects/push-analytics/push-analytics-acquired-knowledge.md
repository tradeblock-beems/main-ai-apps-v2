# Push Analytics Project - Acquired Knowledge

This file serves as a centralized knowledge repository capturing durable insights, repeatable patterns, key lessons learned, and domain-specific principles uncovered during the project. This knowledge is intended to reduce ramp time on future projects and continuously compound team expertise.

## EXECUTION: Multi-Agent Relay Protocol for Phase 0
- **Context**: Needed to coordinate technical assessment across multiple specialized agents (@dev-hub-dev, @architect, @scribe) in single conversational turn
- **What We Learned**: Multi-agent relay protocol enables efficient collaboration - primary agent executes core tasks, explicitly hands off to collaborating agents for specialized input, then continues to completion. Each agent builds on previous work within same turn.
- **Future Use**: This pattern is highly reusable for any project phase requiring cross-functional collaboration. Can be generalized as: Primary Agent → Collaborative Agent(s) → Documentation Agent → Completion handoff.

## ARCHITECTURE: Leveraging Existing System Integration Points
- **Context**: Push analytics project needed to integrate with existing push automation infrastructure without disrupting current operations
- **What We Learned**: Architecture assessment revealed multiple reusable integration patterns: existing database connection infrastructure, proven query optimization approaches, established user ID mapping strategies, and performance-tested processing patterns from automation scripts.
- **Future Use**: Before building new analytics or data processing capabilities, always conduct systematic review of existing system architecture for reusable patterns. This approach reduces development time and ensures consistency with proven infrastructure.

## TECHNICAL PLANNING: Execution Checklist Enhancement Through Domain Expertise
- **Context**: Generic execution checklist needed refinement based on specific technical challenges of analytics pipeline development
- **What We Learned**: Domain experts can significantly improve execution plans by adding specific validation steps, performance requirements, and risk mitigation strategies. Examples: PostHog schema validation, API batch size optimization, statistical significance testing, memory profiling requirements.
- **Future Use**: All future projects should include Phase 0 checklist improvement step where technical leads review and enhance generic plans with domain-specific requirements. This prevents downstream issues and improves execution quality.

## RESOURCE VALIDATION: Infrastructure Assessment Protocol
- **Context**: Needed to validate existing infrastructure capabilities could support new analytics requirements
- **What We Learned**: Systematic resource assessment covering database access, API credentials, development environment, and dependency integration provides confidence in execution feasibility and identifies potential blockers early.
- **Future Use**: Resource assessment template can be generalized for any technical project: Database/Storage Access + API/External Service Access + Development Environment + Dependency Integration + Performance Requirements validation.
