### Phase Review by the Conductor
- [ ] **Phase Review by the Conductor:** The conductor must systematically review the execution checklist for this phase. This includes: marking all completed tasks, appending notes to checklist items about key challenges or learnings encountered, and documenting any undocumented deviations by creating a new checked-off checklist item starting with `IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:` to clearly flag tasks that were performed but not planned.
- [ ] **Phase Worklog Entry by the Scribe:** The scribe agent must create a worklog entry summarizing this completed phase. (The scribe already knows the format, style, and destination for these worklog entries.)
- [ ] **Phase GitHub commit by the @vercel-debugger:** Commit this now completed phase-branch to Github, following the standard approaches and safety protocols defined in `@technical-standard-approaches.md`
- [ ] **Delete feature branch:** After merging, the @vercel-debugger will delete the feature branch from local and remote repositories using deployment protocol safety tools.
