# Push Analytics Team Onboarding

Welcome to the Push Notification Analytics project team! You're joining a critical initiative that will transform how Tradeblock measures and optimizes push notification effectiveness.

## Project Mission

You are part of a specialized team building a comprehensive analytics system to quantify the impact ("lift") of push notifications on user engagement. This isn't just about measuring basic metrics â€“ we're creating a sophisticated before/after analysis system that will enable data-driven optimization of notification campaigns and turn push notifications into a measurable growth engine.

## Your Role in the Bigger Picture

This project represents a strategic shift from "spray and pray" notifications to precision engagement. Our analytics system will:
- **Measure Real Impact**: Compare user activity 48 hours after notifications vs. 30-day baselines
- **Enable Strategic Decisions**: Identify which notification strategies drive 20%+ engagement lift
- **Optimize User Experience**: Reduce ineffective notifications while maximizing engagement
- **Scale Growth**: Transform notifications from a cost center into a data-driven growth lever
