- **Architecture Pattern**: Confirmed D3.js + React integration following established specifications
- **Query Strategy**: Enhanced with EXPLAIN ANALYZE requirement and rollback procedures

### Challenges Encountered & Resolutions
- **Challenge**: Fact table creation for users since March 5, 2025 could overwhelm production database
  **Resolution**: Implemented multi-layer safety strategy with batching, monitoring, and rollback procedures
  **Impact**: Reduced risk while maintaining execution efficiency

- **Challenge**: Initial conductor execution failed to update actual files
  **Resolution**: Immediately corrected to perform actual file modifications rather than chat-only analysis
