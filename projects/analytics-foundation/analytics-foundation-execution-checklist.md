- [ ] **Phase GitHub commit by the @vercel-debugger:** Commit this now completed phase-branch to Github, following standard approaches and safety protocols
- [ ] **Delete feature branch:** After merging, the @vercel-debugger will delete the feature branch from local and remote repositories

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Primary Owner:** @project-agent-dev-hub-dev with @squad-agent-architect review

- [ ] Review all tasks for this phase. Is there anything to tweak based on what we discovered, learned, or changed in the previous phase?
- [ ] **@vercel-debugger**: Create new feature branch following `@technical-standard-approaches.md`
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing:**
  - [ ] Verify localhost:3003 loads the dashboard successfully
  - [ ] Test all date range options (7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days)
  - [ ] Confirm chart data matches database queries
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior on desktop and tablet viewports
  - [ ] Verify loading states appear during data fetching
  - [ ] Test error handling when database/API is unavailable
- [ ] **Performance Validation:**
  - [ ] Chart renders smoothly with 90 days of data
  - [ ] API responses complete within acceptable time limits
  - [ ] No memory leaks during repeated date range changes
  - [ ] Database queries perform efficiently without timeouts
- [ ] **Code Quality Review:**
  - [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes without errors
  - [ ] All components have proper error boundaries
  - [ ] API routes include comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Database connections are properly managed and cleaned up
- [ ] **@squad-agent-architect Architecture Review:**
  - [ ] System architecture follows established patterns
  - [ ] Database query optimization is appropriate
  - [ ] Component structure supports future expansion
  - [ ] Performance characteristics meet requirements
- [ ] **Documentation & Handoff:**
  - [ ] Update README with setup and development instructions
  - [ ] Document API endpoints and data formats
  - [ ] Create developer guide for adding new chart types
  - [ ] Document database schema and fact table structure
- [ ] **Final Validation:**
  - [ ] Complete functional test: localhost:3003 displays working new users bar chart
  - [ ] Date range toggle functions correctly across all options
  - [ ] Data accuracy verified against source database
  - [ ] UI follows design specifications (blue/slate theme, responsive layout)
  - [ ] Foundation is ready for future analytics features
- [ ] **Phase Review by the Conductor:** The conductor must systematically review the execution checklist for this phase, marking completed tasks and documenting any deviations
- [ ] **Phase Worklog Entry by the Scribe:** The scribe agent must create a worklog entry summarizing this completed phase
- [ ] **Phase GitHub commit by the @vercel-debugger:** Commit this now completed phase-branch to Github, following standard approaches and safety protocols
- [ ] **Delete feature branch:** After merging, the @vercel-debugger will delete the feature branch from local and remote repositories
