# Analytics Foundation Execution Checklist

## Phase 0: Execution Checklist Improvement
**Primary Owner:** @squad-agent-architect

- [x] Review all phases of this execution checklist after completing agent onboarding and project brief review
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Completed comprehensive review of all 7 phases. Identified critical database performance risks and enhanced Phase 3 strategy. All phases validated for technical feasibility and architectural soundness.

- [x] Apply architectural expertise to improve the execution plan, focusing on database optimization and system performance
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Enhanced database strategy: reduced batch size from 1000 to 500 users, added connection pooling (max 5 connections), implemented 30-second query timeouts, and added real-time performance monitoring with automatic pause triggers.

- [x] Scrutinize the existing plan to reduce chance of technical issues, especially around database query optimization
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Added comprehensive database safeguards: EXPLAIN ANALYZE requirement before full execution, enhanced error handling with PostgreSQL-specific error codes, data validation checkpoints, and rollback procedures for failed batches.

- [x] Review `@technical-standard-approaches.md` and update this checklist to follow standard approaches
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Validated technical stack alignment (Next.js 15.x, TypeScript 5.x, D3.js 7.x). Enhanced error boundary requirements, added TypeScript strict mode validation, and confirmed port 3003 standalone operation strategy.

- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Database Master Query Strategy Review - @squad-agent-database-master validated all Phase 3 query approaches and optimized fact table creation strategy with performance safeguards
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Database strategy comprehensively reviewed and approved. Enhanced with query plan analysis, connection retry logic, and materialized view recommendations for API layer.

- [x] **Phase Review by the Conductor:** The conductor must systematically review the execution checklist for this phase. This includes: marking all completed tasks, appending notes to checklist items about key challenges or learnings encountered, and documenting any undocumented deviations by creating a new checked-off checklist item starting with `IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:` to clearly flag tasks that were performed but not planned.
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Phase 0 execution completed successfully with all architectural improvements implemented and database strategy validated. Ready for Phase 1 execution.

- [x] **Phase Worklog Entry by the Scribe:** The scribe agent must create a worklog entry summarizing this completed phase
***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Worklog entry completed documenting all technical decisions, performance optimizations, and handoff notes for subsequent phases.
