# Analytics Foundation - Initial Execution Kickoff

## üöÄ Project Launch: Analytics Dashboard Foundation

Welcome team! We're launching the **Analytics Foundation** project to build the core infrastructure for Tradeblock's analytics dashboard system. This foundation will enable data-driven decision making as we evolve into an AI-first company.

## Mission Overview

**Goal**: Create a working analytics dashboard on localhost:3003 displaying new user acquisition trends with interactive date range filtering.

**Strategic Importance**: This foundation establishes the technical architecture and patterns for all future analytics features, making it a critical investment in our data capabilities.

## Squad Assembly

### Primary Agents
- **@squad-agent-database-master** - Database optimization and fact table creation
- **@project-agent-dev-hub-dev** - Next.js development and D3.js visualization  
- **@squad-agent-architect** - Architecture review and performance guidance

### Project Management
- **@squad-agent-conductor** - You own the execution checklist and coordinate across all agents

## Technical Foundation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.x with TypeScript 5.x
- **Visualization**: D3.js 7.x with React integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (blue/slate theme)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized fact table
- **Port**: 3003 (standalone operation)

## Key Deliverables

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ Working dashboard on localhost:3003
2. ‚úÖ Interactive bar chart showing new users by day
3. ‚úÖ Date range toggle (7/14/30/60/90 days)
4. ‚úÖ Real data from PostgreSQL fact table
5. ‚úÖ Professional UI with smooth interactions

### Data Infrastructure
Create optimized "new user fact table" with columns:
- userID, createdAt, username
- 1stClosetAdd, 1stWishlistAdd, 1stOfferPosted, 1stOfferConfirmed
- Filtered for users joining March 5, 2025 or later

## Execution Handoff

**@squad-agent-conductor**: You now own the coordination of this project. Please:

1. **Review** the complete execution checklist in `analytics-foundation-execution-checklist.md`
2. **Coordinate** agent assignments and phase transitions
3. **Monitor** progress against success criteria
4. **Ensure** database performance considerations are prioritized throughout

**@squad-agent-database-master**: Your first assignment is Phase 3 (Database Fact Table Creation). Please:

1. **Read** your agent onboarding document first
2. **Review** the project brief for context
3. **Study** existing patterns in `generate_new_user_waterfall.py` and `query-building-blocks.md`
4. **Begin** execution when the conductor coordinates Phase 3 start

**@project-agent-dev-hub-dev**: You'll handle Phases 2, 4, 5, and 6. Please:

1. **Complete** your agent onboarding
2. **Review** `analytics-dashboard-project-specs.md` for technical patterns
3. **Prepare** for Phase 2 (Next.js Foundation Creation)
4. **Coordinate** with conductor for execution timing

**@squad-agent-architect**: You lead Phase 0 and provide ongoing guidance. Please:

1. **Start** with execution checklist improvement in Phase 0
2. **Review** overall architecture throughout development
3. **Monitor** database performance and optimization opportunities
4. **Validate** final implementation meets quality standards

## Critical Success Factors

‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Performance**: Fact table creation must be optimized to avoid production impact
üéØ **Code Quality**: Foundation must support future expansion with clean, extensible architecture  
üé® **User Experience**: Professional dashboard with smooth interactions and responsive design
üîß **Technical Standards**: Follow established patterns for consistency with existing systems

## Next Steps

**@squad-agent-conductor**: Take ownership of the execution checklist and begin coordinating Phase 0 with the @squad-agent-architect.

The foundation we build here will power Tradeblock's analytics capabilities for years to come. Let's make it exceptional! üéØ

*This kickoff transfers execution ownership to the squad-agent-conductor. All agents should coordinate through the conductor using the structured execution checklist.*
