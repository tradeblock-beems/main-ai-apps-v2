# Analytics Foundation Project Brief

## Project Vision

Build the foundational architecture for Tradeblock's analytics dashboard system. This project establishes the technical foundation, data infrastructure, and initial visualization capabilities that will expand over time into a comprehensive analytics platform.

## Why This Matters

As Tradeblock transforms into an AI-first company, having robust analytics capabilities is critical for:
- Understanding user behavior patterns and onboarding effectiveness
- Making data-driven decisions about product features and user experience
- Identifying opportunities for automation and optimization
- Providing visibility into key business metrics and trends

This foundation phase focuses on proving the technical architecture and delivering the first working analytics visualization: new user acquisition trends.

## What We're Building

### Core Deliverable
A standalone Next.js analytics dashboard running on localhost:3003 that displays an interactive bar chart showing new users by day, with date range filtering capabilities.

### Technical Foundation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.x with App Router and TypeScript 5.x
- **Visualization**: D3.js 7.x integrated with React components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with professional blue/slate design system
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL integration with optimized fact table architecture
- **Deployment Target**: Vercel-ready for future production deployment

### Data Infrastructure
Create a "new user fact table" containing:
- `userID`: Unique identifier
- `createdAt`: Join date (filtered for March 5, 2025+)
- `username`: Display name
- `1stClosetAdd`: Date of first closet item addition (NULL if never)
- `1stWishlistAdd`: Date of first wishlist addition (NULL if never) 
- `1stOfferPosted`: Date of first offer creation (NULL if never)
- `1stOfferConfirmed`: Date of first offer confirmation (NULL if never)

## Strategic Context

### Business Goals
- Establish analytics capability foundation for future AI-driven insights
- Create visibility into new user onboarding funnel effectiveness
- Build expandable platform for additional analytics features
- Demonstrate technical capability for data-driven decision making

### Technical Goals
- Prove D3.js + React integration patterns for complex visualizations
- Establish efficient database querying patterns for analytics workloads
- Create reusable component architecture for future chart types
- Validate performance characteristics of analytics data processing

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
1. ✅ **Localhost:3003 displays working dashboard** with new users bar chart
2. ✅ **Date range toggle functions correctly** (last 7/14/30/60/90 days)
3. ✅ **Data loads efficiently** without overwhelming database performance
4. ✅ **Professional UI** following established design patterns
5. ✅ **Clean codebase** with TypeScript interfaces and proper error handling
6. ✅ **Extensible architecture** ready for additional chart types and metrics

### Quality Standards
- **Performance**: Chart renders smoothly with 1000+ data points
- **Responsiveness**: Works well on desktop and tablet viewports
- **Data Accuracy**: New user counts match database reality
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, proper error boundaries
- **User Experience**: Intuitive controls and loading states

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **Port Allocation**: Must use port 3003 (3001/3002 occupied by push-blaster systems)
- **Database Load**: Fact table creation must be optimized to avoid performance impact
- **Standalone Operation**: No dependencies on existing push-blaster infrastructure
- **Tech Stack Compatibility**: Use same versions as existing projects for future integration

### Development Approach
- **Start with Mock Data**: Prove visualization layer before connecting real database
- **Incremental Database Integration**: Connect real data after UI foundation is solid
- **Performance First**: Optimize database queries from the beginning
- **Extensibility Focus**: Build patterns that support future analytics features

## Future Expansion Potential

This foundation enables future analytics features:
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Conversion funnels, retention cohorts, activity patterns
- **Trading Analytics**: Volume trends, popular items, market dynamics
- **Performance Metrics**: App performance, feature usage, engagement scores
- **Business Intelligence**: Revenue tracking, user lifetime value, growth metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### Database Performance Risk
- Use query batching and optimization from established patterns
- Implement proper indexing strategy for fact table
- Monitor query performance throughout development

### Integration Complexity Risk
- Build as standalone system initially
- Use compatible tech stack for future integration
- Document all APIs and data interfaces clearly

### Scope Creep Risk  
- Focus strictly on new user bar chart for Phase 1
- Resist adding additional chart types until foundation is solid
- Document expansion ideas in acquired knowledge for future phases

## Team Alignment

This project leverages existing squad expertise:
- **@squad-agent-database-master**: Database optimization and fact table creation
- **@squad-agent-architect**: System architecture and performance guidance  
- **@project-agent-dev-hub-dev**: Next.js development and D3.js integration

The foundation built here will support Tradeblock's evolution into a data-driven, AI-first organization while providing immediate value through new user acquisition insights.
