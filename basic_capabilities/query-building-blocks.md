## Core User Targeting Patterns

### 1. **User's Top Desired Item** 
*Identifies the item a user wants most based on engagement intensity*

```sql
WITH ranked_desired_items AS (
    SELECT
        di.user_id,
        di.product_variant_id,
        p.name as product_name,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
            PARTITION BY di.user_id 
            ORDER BY di.offers_count DESC, di.created_at DESC
        ) as rn
    FROM desired_items di
    JOIN product_variants pv ON di.product_variant_id = pv.id
    JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
    WHERE di.user_id = ANY(%(user_ids)s::uuid[]) 
    AND di.deleted_at = 0
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    product_variant_id,
    product_name
FROM ranked_desired_items
WHERE rn = 1;
```

**Key Insights:**
- Uses `offers_count` as primary ranking (strongest desire indicator)
- Falls back to `created_at DESC` for tiebreaking
- Filters out deleted items with `deleted_at = 0`

### 2. **User's Most Recent Offer Target**
*Finds the last item a user actively made an offer for*

```sql
WITH ranked_offers AS (
    SELECT
        o.creator_user_id,
        oi.product_variant_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY o.creator_user_id 
            ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
        ) as rn
    FROM offers o
    JOIN offer_items oi ON o.id = oi.offer_id
    WHERE o.creator_user_id = ANY(%(user_ids)s::uuid[])
)
SELECT
    ro.creator_user_id as user_id,
    p.name,
    pv.id as variantid
FROM ranked_offers ro
JOIN product_variants pv ON ro.product_variant_id = pv.id
JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE ro.rn = 1;
```

**Key Insights:**
- Captures actual purchase intent (user made an offer)
- Time-based ranking shows most recent interest
- Joins through `offer_items` to get the specific products

### 3. **User's Newest Wishlist Addition**
*Identifies the most recently added item to a user's wishlist*

```sql
WITH ranked_wishlist AS (
    SELECT
        wi.user_id,
        wi.product_variant_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY wi.user_id 
            ORDER BY wi.created_at DESC
        ) as rn
    FROM wishlist_items wi
    WHERE wi.user_id = ANY(%(user_ids)s::uuid[])
    AND wi.deleted_at = 0
)
SELECT
    rw.user_id,
    p.name,
    pv.id as variantid
FROM ranked_wishlist rw
JOIN product_variants pv ON rw.product_variant_id = pv.id
JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE rw.rn = 1;
```

**Key Insights:**
- Represents browsing interest and window shopping behavior
- Most recent addition indicates current taste/preferences
- Good fallback when no stronger intent signals exist

## User Activity & Filtering Patterns

### 4. **General Engaged Audience**
*Broad audience filter based on activity, closet size, and trading history*

```sql
WITH user_size_preferences AS (
    SELECT
        up.user_id,
        av.value AS shoe_size
    FROM user_preferences up
    JOIN attribute_preferences ap ON up.id = ap.user_preference_id
    JOIN attributes a ON ap.attribute_id = a.id
    JOIN attribute_values av ON ap.attribute_value_id = av.id
    WHERE a.name = 'mens_size' AND ap.preferred = TRUE
),
user_stats AS (
    SELECT
        u.id as user_id,
        u.email as user_email,
        u.first_name as user_first_name,
        usp.shoe_size,
        COALESCE(ci.closet_count, 0) as closet_items,
        COALESCE(trade_stats.lifetime_trades, 0) as lifetime_trades,
        COALESCE(EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (NOW() - u.last_active_at)), 999999) as days_since_last_active
    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN user_size_preferences usp ON u.id = usp.user_id
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as closet_count
        FROM closet_items 
        WHERE deleted_at = 0 
        GROUP BY user_id
    ) ci ON u.id = ci.user_id
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT 
            user_id,
            COUNT(*) as lifetime_trades
        FROM (
            SELECT creator_user_id as user_id FROM offers WHERE offer_status = 'COMPLETED'
            UNION ALL
            SELECT receiver_user_id as user_id FROM offers WHERE offer_status = 'COMPLETED'
        ) all_trades
        GROUP BY user_id
    ) trade_stats ON u.id = trade_stats.user_id
)
SELECT 
    user_id,
    user_email,
    user_first_name,
    shoe_size
FROM user_stats
WHERE days_since_last_active <= %(max_days_inactive)s
AND closet_items >= %(min_closet_items)s
AND lifetime_trades >= %(min_lifetime_trades)s
AND user_email IS NOT NULL
AND user_first_name IS NOT NULL
AND shoe_size IS NOT NULL;
```

**Key Insights:**
- Combines multiple engagement signals (activity, inventory, trading)
- Configurable thresholds for different campaign types
- Ensures complete data for email personalization
- Efficient single-query approach with CTEs

### 5. **Recently Validated Traders**
*Identifies users who have completed successful trades recently*

```sql
SELECT o.creator_user_id AS user_id
FROM trades t
JOIN offers o ON t.offer_id = o.id
WHERE t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL 
AND t.validation_passed_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
UNION
SELECT o.receiver_user_id AS user_id
FROM trades t
JOIN offers o ON t.offer_id = o.id
WHERE t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL 
AND t.validation_passed_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

**Key Insights:**
- `validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL` is the definitive trade completion indicator
- UNION captures both sides of the trade (creator and receiver)
- Configurable time window (90 days in this example)

### 6. **Recently Active Offer Makers**
*Finds users who have completed offers recently (broader activity measure)*

```sql
SELECT creator_user_id AS user_id FROM offers
WHERE offer_status = 'COMPLETED'
AND confirmed_trade_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
UNION
SELECT receiver_user_id AS user_id FROM offers
WHERE offer_status = 'COMPLETED'
AND confirmed_trade_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

**Key Insights:**
- Broader activity measure than validated trades
- Includes offers that completed but may not have resulted in validated trades
- Good for identifying engaged users who are actively participating

### 7. **Complete User Profile Data**
*Fetches essential user data with size preferences*

```sql
WITH user_size_preferences AS (
    SELECT
        up.user_id,
        av.value AS shoe_size
    FROM user_preferences up
    JOIN attribute_preferences ap ON up.id = ap.user_preference_id
    JOIN attributes a ON ap.attribute_id = a.id
    JOIN attribute_values av ON ap.attribute_value_id = av.id
    WHERE a.name = 'mens_size' AND ap.preferred = TRUE
)
SELECT 
    u.id as user_id,
    u.email,
    u.first_name,
    usp.shoe_size as user_size
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_size_preferences usp ON u.id = usp.user_id
WHERE u.id = ANY(%(user_ids)s::uuid[]);
```

**Key Insights:**
- Navigates the complex attribute preferences system
- Filters for preferred size (`ap.preferred = TRUE`)
- Uses LEFT JOIN to include users even without size preferences

### 8. **Dynamic User Segmentation**
*Flexible user filtering with configurable criteria for account age, activity, engagement, and trading metrics*

```sql
WITH user_closet_counts AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(id) AS count
    FROM inventory_items
    WHERE status = 'OPEN_FOR_TRADE'
    GROUP BY user_id
),
user_wishlist_counts AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(id) AS count
    FROM wishlist_items
    WHERE deleted_at = 0
    GROUP BY user_id
),
user_offers_last_90_days AS (
    SELECT creator_user_id as user_id, COUNT(id) AS count
    FROM offers
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
    GROUP BY creator_user_id
),
user_validated_trades_last_90_days AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM (
        SELECT o.creator_user_id as user_id
        FROM trades t
        JOIN offers o ON t.offer_id = o.id
        WHERE t.validation_passed_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
            AND t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL
        UNION ALL
        SELECT o.receiver_user_id as user_id
        FROM trades t
        JOIN offers o ON t.offer_id = o.id
        WHERE t.validation_passed_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
            AND t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL
    ) all_trade_users
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    u.id as user_id,
    u.completed_trades_count,
    COALESCE(ucc.count, 0) as closet_count,
    COALESCE(uwc.count, 0) as wishlist_count,
    COALESCE(uo90.count, 0) as offers_last_90_days,
    COALESCE(uvt90.count, 0) as validated_trades_last_90_days
FROM users u
JOIN user_activities ua ON u.id = ua.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_closet_counts ucc ON u.id = ucc.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_wishlist_counts uwc ON u.id = uwc.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_offers_last_90_days uo90 ON u.id = uo90.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_validated_trades_last_90_days uvt90 ON u.id = uvt90.user_id
WHERE u.deleted_at = 0 
AND u.email IS NOT NULL
AND ua.last_active >= NOW() - INTERVAL '180 days'  -- Automatic 180-day activity filter
-- Add dynamic filters as needed:
-- AND u.created_at <= NOW() - make_interval(days => %(min_creation_days)s)
-- AND ua.last_active >= NOW() - make_interval(days => %(max_last_active_days)s)
-- AND u.completed_trades_count >= %(min_trades_count)s
-- AND COALESCE(ucc.count, 0) >= %(min_closet_count)s
-- AND COALESCE(uwc.count, 0) >= %(min_wishlist_count)s
```

**Key Insights:**
- Pre-aggregates all key user metrics using CTEs for performance
- Combines recent activity (90 days) with lifetime metrics
- Automatic 180-day activity filter ensures only engaged users
- Flexible WHERE clause structure allows dynamic filtering
- Single query approach scales efficiently for large user bases

## Product & Variant Data Patterns

### 8. **Product Details with Recent Statistics**
*Fetches product information with configurable lookback period for stats*

```sql
WITH recent_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        p.id as product_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_days)s days' THEN oi.offer_id END) as recent_offers,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wi.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_days)s days' THEN wi.user_id END) as recent_wishlist_adds,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ci.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_days)s days' THEN ci.user_id END) as recent_closet_adds
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN product_variants pv ON p.id = pv.product_id
    LEFT JOIN offer_items oi ON pv.id = oi.product_variant_id
    LEFT JOIN offers o ON oi.offer_id = o.id
    LEFT JOIN wishlist_items wi ON pv.id = wi.product_variant_id AND wi.deleted_at = 0
    LEFT JOIN closet_items ci ON pv.id = ci.product_variant_id AND ci.deleted_at = 0
    WHERE p.id = ANY(%(product_ids)s::uuid[])
    GROUP BY p.id
)
SELECT 
    p.id as product_id,
    p.name as product_name,
    p.index_cache->>'brand' as brand,
    p.index_cache->>'colorway' as colorway,
    p.index_cache->>'retail_price' as retail_price,
    rs.recent_offers,
    rs.recent_wishlist_adds,
    rs.recent_closet_adds
FROM products p
JOIN recent_stats rs ON p.id = rs.product_id
WHERE p.id = ANY(%(product_ids)s::uuid[]);
```

**Key Insights:**
- Configurable lookback period for "recent" activity
- Aggregates multiple engagement metrics per product
- Uses `index_cache` for quick access to product attributes
- Handles deleted items appropriately

### 9. **Variant-Level Data with Size-Specific Statistics**
*Gets detailed variant information with size-specific engagement metrics*

```sql
WITH variant_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        pv.id as variant_id,
        pv.product_id,
        pv.index_cache->>'mens_size' as size,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_days)s days' THEN oi.offer_id END) as recent_offers_to_get,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wi.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_days)s days' THEN wi.user_id END) as total_wishlist_adds,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ci.user_id) as total_closet_owners
    FROM product_variants pv
    LEFT JOIN offer_items oi ON pv.id = oi.product_variant_id
    LEFT JOIN offers o ON oi.offer_id = o.id
    LEFT JOIN wishlist_items wi ON pv.id = wi.product_variant_id AND wi.deleted_at = 0
    LEFT JOIN closet_items ci ON pv.id = ci.product_variant_id AND ci.deleted_at = 0
    WHERE pv.product_id = ANY(%(product_ids)s::uuid[])
    GROUP BY pv.id, pv.product_id, pv.index_cache->>'mens_size'
)
SELECT 
    variant_id,
    product_id,
    size,
    recent_offers_to_get,
    total_wishlist_adds,
    total_closet_owners
FROM variant_stats
WHERE size IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY product_id, CAST(size AS NUMERIC);
```

**Key Insights:**
- Size-specific engagement metrics for personalization
- Mixes recent activity (offers) with all-time totals (closet ownership)
- Filters out variants without size information
- Orders by size for logical presentation

## User Analytics & Scoring Patterns

### 11. **Multi-Metric User Scoring**
*Calculates weighted scores from multiple user engagement metrics with normalization and tier assignment*

```python
def calculate_and_assign_scores(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Normalizes data, calculates propensity scores, and assigns tiers to the user DataFrame.
    
    SCORING FORMULA:
    - 50% - Offers created in last 90 days (primary indicator of trading intent)
    - 30% - Lifetime completed trades (historical trading success)  
    - 20% - Current closet size (having inventory to trade)
    """
    if df.empty:
        return pd.DataFrame()

    # Convert all metric columns to numeric, coercing errors to NaN
    metric_columns = ['completed_trades_count', 'closet_count', 'offers_last_90_days']
    for col in metric_columns:
        df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col], errors='coerce')

    # Drop rows where conversion failed
    df.dropna(subset=metric_columns, inplace=True)

    # Rename for clarity
    df.rename(columns={
        'completed_trades_count': 'lifetime_trades',
        'closet_count': 'closet_size'
    }, inplace=True)

    # Min-Max Normalization for each metric
    metrics_to_normalize = ['offers_last_90_days', 'lifetime_trades', 'closet_size']
    for metric in metrics_to_normalize:
        min_val = df[metric].min()
        max_val = df[metric].max()
        df[f'normalized_{metric}'] = (df[metric] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) if (max_val - min_val) > 0 else 0

    # Weighted Score Calculation
    weights = {
        'offers_last_90_days': 0.5,  # 50% - Primary indicator of trading intent
        'lifetime_trades': 0.3,      # 30% - Historical trading success  
        'closet_size': 0.2           # 20% - Having inventory to trade
    }
    df['trade_propensity_score'] = (
        df['normalized_offers_last_90_days'] * weights['offers_last_90_days'] +
        df['normalized_lifetime_trades'] * weights['lifetime_trades'] +
        df['normalized_closet_size'] * weights['closet_size']
    ).astype(float)

    # Percentile-based Tiering
    def assign_tier(score):
        if score == 0:
            return 'NO POTENTIAL'
        elif score >= df['trade_propensity_score'].quantile(0.95):
            return 'TOP PROSPECTS'
        elif score >= df['trade_propensity_score'].quantile(0.80):
            return 'ENGAGED'
        else:
            return 'CASUAL'
    
    df['propensity_tier'] = df['trade_propensity_score'].apply(assign_tier)
    return df
```

**Key Insights:**
- Min-max normalization ensures all metrics contribute equally despite different scales
- Weighted formula prioritizes recent activity over historical metrics
- Percentile-based tiers create consistent distribution regardless of absolute scores
- Handles edge cases (zero scores, missing data) gracefully
- Configurable weights allow easy adjustment of scoring priorities

### 12. **Comprehensive User Analytics**
*Fetches complete user analytics combining recent activity with lifetime metrics for advanced segmentation*

```sql
-- This pattern is implemented in the Dynamic User Segmentation building block (#8)
-- Key additions for analytics use cases:

-- Additional metrics that can be added to the base segmentation query:
SELECT
    -- Base metrics from Dynamic User Segmentation
    u.id as user_id,
    u.completed_trades_count,
    COALESCE(ucc.count, 0) as closet_count,
    COALESCE(uwc.count, 0) as wishlist_count,
    COALESCE(uo90.count, 0) as offers_last_90_days,
    COALESCE(uvt90.count, 0) as validated_trades_last_90_days,
    
    -- Additional analytics metrics:
    EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (NOW() - u.created_at)) as account_age_days,
    EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (NOW() - ua.last_active)) as days_since_last_active,
    u.created_at as account_creation_date,
    ua.last_active as last_active_date
FROM users u
JOIN user_activities ua ON u.id = ua.user_id
-- ... rest of query from Dynamic User Segmentation pattern
```

**Key Insights:**
- Extends Dynamic User Segmentation with additional temporal analytics
- Combines recent activity windows (90 days) with lifetime totals
- Provides both absolute dates and calculated day differences
- Enables sophisticated cohort analysis and user lifecycle tracking
- Foundation for machine learning feature engineering

## Advanced Patterns

### 13. **Size-Based User-Product Matching**
*Efficiently matches users to products based on their size preferences*

```python
# Create nested lookup structure for O(1) access
variants_by_product_and_size = {}
for variant in variants_data:
    try:
        product_id = variant['product_id']
        size = float(variant['size'])
        if product_id not in variants_by_product_and_size:
            variants_by_product_and_size[product_id] = {}
        variants_by_product_and_size[product_id][size] = variant
    except (ValueError, TypeError, KeyError):
        continue

# Match users to variants by size
final_data = []
for user in audience_data:
    try:
        user_size = float(user.get('shoe_size'))
        row = {
            'email': user.get('user_email'),
            'firstname': user.get('user_first_name'),
            'usersize': user.get('shoe_size'),
        }
        
        matched_at_least_one = False
        for i, product_id in enumerate(product_ids, 1):
            variant = variants_by_product_and_size.get(product_id, {}).get(user_size)
            
            if variant:
                matched_at_least_one = True
                row[f'feat_shoe{i}_variantid'] = variant.get('variant_id')
                row[f'feat_shoe{i}_offers_in_size'] = variant.get('recent_offers_to_get')
                # ... additional variant fields
            else:
                # Handle missing variant data
                row[f'feat_shoe{i}_variantid'] = None
                # ... set other fields to None
        
        if matched_at_least_one:
            final_data.append(row)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        continue
```

**Key Insights:**
- Pre-builds lookup structure for efficient matching
- Handles size conversion and validation gracefully
- Only includes users who match at least one product
- Scalable pattern for multiple product features

### 14. **Multi-Tier Fallback Strategy**
*Pattern for finding the "best available" data with multiple fallback options*

```python
# Primary: Desired items (highest intent)
primary_results = get_top_target_shoe_for_users(user_ids)
target_shoes = {item['user_id']: item for item in primary_results}

# Secondary: Recent offers (medium intent)
users_needing_fallback = [uid for uid in user_ids if uid not in target_shoes]
if users_needing_fallback:
    fallback_results = get_last_offered_shoe_for_users(users_needing_fallback)
    target_shoes.update(fallback_results)

# Tertiary: Wishlist items (low intent, but something)
users_still_needing_fallback = [uid for uid in user_ids if uid not in target_shoes]
if users_still_needing_fallback:
    final_fallback = get_newest_wishlist_item_for_users(users_still_needing_fallback)
    target_shoes.update(final_fallback)
```

**Key Insights:**
- Prioritizes data sources by intent strength
- Maximizes coverage while maintaining data quality
- Only queries subsequent tiers for users who need them (efficiency)

### 15. **Data Quality Filtering**
*Ensures all users have complete, usable data for email campaigns*

```python
# Filter for complete data
qualified_users = []
for user_id in user_ids:
    user_data = all_user_data.get(user_id)
    target_shoe = target_shoes.get(user_id)
    
    # Must have basic email data
    if not user_data or not user_data.get('email') or not user_data.get('first_name') or not user_data.get('user_size'):
        continue
    
    # Must have personalization data
    if not target_shoe:
        continue
        
    qualified_users.append(user_id)
```

**Key Insights:**
- Validates both basic user data AND personalization data
- Prevents sending emails with missing/broken personalization
- Clear separation of data quality vs. business logic filtering

### 16. **Hunter/Active User Identification by Size**
*Finds the most active users (hunters) for specific shoe sizes based on recent offer activity*

```sql
WITH size_based_hunters AS (
    SELECT 
        u.id as hunter_user_id,
        u.username as hunter_username,
        f.path as hunter_avatar_path,
        u.completed_trades_count as hunter_trade_count,
        pv.index_cache->>'mens_size' as size,
        COUNT(o.id) as offers_for_product,
        p.name as target_product_name,
        (SELECT f2.path FROM files f2 WHERE f2.product_id = p.id ORDER BY f2."order" ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1) as target_product_image_path,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY pv.index_cache->>'mens_size' 
            ORDER BY COUNT(o.id) DESC, u.completed_trades_count DESC
        ) as hunter_rank
    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN files f ON u.avatar_id = f.id
    JOIN offers o ON u.id = o.creator_user_id
    JOIN offer_items oi ON o.id = oi.offer_id
    JOIN product_variants pv ON oi.product_variant_id = pv.id
    JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
    WHERE o.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_days)s days'
    AND pv.index_cache->>'mens_size' = ANY(%(target_sizes)s::text[])
    AND u.deleted_at = 0
    GROUP BY u.id, u.username, f.path, u.completed_trades_count, pv.index_cache->>'mens_size', p.name, p.id
)
SELECT 
    size,
    hunter_user_id,
    hunter_username,
    hunter_avatar_path,
    hunter_trade_count,
    offers_for_product,
    target_product_name,
    target_product_image_path
FROM size_based_hunters
WHERE hunter_rank <= 3
ORDER BY size, hunter_rank;
```

**Key Insights:**
- Ranks users by recent offer activity within each size category
- Includes user profile data (username, avatar, trade history) for personalization
- Limits to top 3 hunters per size for focused targeting
- Configurable lookback period for "recent" activity definition

### 17. **Standard Size Range Processing**
*Efficiently processes a predefined set of standard shoe sizes for campaign targeting*

```python
# Standard set of men's shoe sizes for campaigns
STANDARD_SHOE_SIZES = [
    '4', '4.5', '5', '5.5', '6', '6.5', '7', '7.5', '8', '8.5', '9', '9.5', 
    '10', '10.5', '11', '11.5', '12', '12.5', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18'
]

def process_by_standard_sizes(data_function, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Generic function to process data across all standard shoe sizes.
    
    Args:
        data_function: Function that takes sizes as first parameter
        *args: Additional arguments to pass to data_function
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to data_function
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping size to results for that size
    """
    results_by_size = {}
    
    # Process all sizes in a single query for efficiency
    all_results = data_function(STANDARD_SHOE_SIZES, *args, **kwargs)
    
    # Group results by size
    for result in all_results:
        size = result.get('size')
        if size not in results_by_size:
            results_by_size[size] = []
        results_by_size[size].append(result)
    
    return results_by_size
```

**Key Insights:**
- Standardized size range ensures consistency across campaigns
- Single query processing is more efficient than individual size queries
- Generic processing function can be reused for different data types
- Results grouped by size for easy lookup and matching

### 18. **Multi-User Data Flattening**
*Flattens multiple user records into single CSV rows for email campaigns featuring multiple users*

```python
def format_multi_user_data_for_row(users: List[Dict[str, Any]], max_users: int = 3, prefix: str = 'user') -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Flattens a list of user dictionaries into a single CSV row structure.
    
    Args:
        users: List of user dictionaries with their data
        max_users: Maximum number of users to include (default 3)
        prefix: Prefix for the flattened field names (e.g., 'hunter', 'user')
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with flattened user data suitable for CSV row
    """
    flat_data = {}
    
    # Flatten data for each user
    for i, user in enumerate(users[:max_users], 1):
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_username'] = user.get('username')
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_avatar'] = user.get('avatar_path')
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_userid'] = user.get('user_id')
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_tradecount'] = user.get('trade_count')
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_offers7d'] = user.get('recent_offers')
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_target1_name'] = user.get('target_product_name')
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_target1_image'] = user.get('target_product_image')
    
    # Fill remaining columns with nulls if fewer users than max
    for i in range(len(users) + 1, max_users + 1):
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_username'] = None
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_avatar'] = None
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_userid'] = None
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_tradecount'] = None
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_offers7d'] = None
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_target1_name'] = None
        flat_data[f'{prefix}{i}_target1_image'] = None
    
    return flat_data

# Usage in CSV generation
for recipient in audience:
    recipient_size = recipient.get('shoe_size')
    hunters_for_size = hunters_by_size.get(recipient_size, [])
    
    if hunters_for_size and len(hunters_for_size) >= 3:
        # Flatten hunter data for CSV row
        hunter_data_flat = format_multi_user_data_for_row(hunters_for_size[:3], prefix='hunter')
        
        row_data = {
            'email': recipient.get('email'),
            'firstname': recipient.get('first_name'),
            'usersize': recipient_size
        }
        row_data.update(hunter_data_flat)
        final_data.append(row_data)
```

**Key Insights:**
- Configurable number of users and field prefix for flexibility
- Ensures consistent CSV structure with null values for missing users
- Reusable pattern for any multi-user email campaign format
- Handles variable numbers of users gracefully

## Additional Building Blocks to Consider

Based on the patterns we've developed, here are some other generalizable building blocks that could be valuable:

### 19. **User's Most Traded Category/Brand**
*Identify what types of shoes a user typically trades*

```sql
-- Find user's most common brand in completed trades
WITH user_trade_brands AS (
    SELECT 
        u.id as user_id,
        p.index_cache->>'brand' as brand,
        COUNT(*) as trade_count
    FROM users u
    JOIN offers o ON u.id IN (o.creator_user_id, o.receiver_user_id)
    JOIN trades t ON o.id = t.offer_id
    JOIN offer_items oi ON o.id = oi.offer_id
    JOIN product_variants pv ON oi.product_variant_id = pv.id
    JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
    WHERE t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY u.id, p.index_cache->>'brand'
)
SELECT user_id, brand, trade_count
FROM user_trade_brands
WHERE (user_id, trade_count) IN (
    SELECT user_id, MAX(trade_count)
    FROM user_trade_brands
    GROUP BY user_id
);
```

### 20. **User's Size Range Analysis**
*Understand what sizes a user actually trades vs. their stated preference*

```sql
-- Compare stated size preference vs. actual trading behavior
WITH actual_traded_sizes AS (
    SELECT 
        u.id as user_id,
        pv.index_cache->>'mens_size' as traded_size,
        COUNT(*) as frequency
    FROM users u
    JOIN offers o ON u.id IN (o.creator_user_id, o.receiver_user_id)
    JOIN trades t ON o.id = t.offer_id
    JOIN offer_items oi ON o.id = oi.offer_id
    JOIN product_variants pv ON oi.product_variant_id = pv.id
    WHERE t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY u.id, pv.index_cache->>'mens_size'
)
-- Could be extended to compare with stated preferences
```

### 21. **Product Popularity Metrics**
*Rank products by various engagement metrics*

```sql
-- Multi-metric product popularity
WITH product_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        p.id,
        p.name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT di.user_id) as desired_by_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT oi.offer_id) as offer_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT wi.user_id) as wishlist_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN t.validation_passed_date IS NOT NULL THEN t.id END) as trade_count
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN product_variants pv ON p.id = pv.product_id
    LEFT JOIN desired_items di ON pv.id = di.product_variant_id AND di.deleted_at = 0
    LEFT JOIN offer_items oi ON pv.id = oi.product_variant_id
    LEFT JOIN offers o ON oi.offer_id = o.id
    LEFT JOIN trades t ON o.id = t.offer_id
    LEFT JOIN wishlist_items wi ON pv.id = wi.product_variant_id AND wi.deleted_at = 0
    GROUP BY p.id, p.name
)
SELECT *, 
    (desired_by_count * 3 + offer_count * 2 + wishlist_count + trade_count * 4) as popularity_score
FROM product_metrics
ORDER BY popularity_score DESC;
```

### 22. **Hottest Item in a User's Closet**
*Identifies the most in-demand item currently in a user's inventory based on global platform activity. The lookback period is now parameterized.*

This pattern first calculates the global "hotness" of every product variant based on recent offer and trade volume, and then joins that data against a specific user's inventory to find the most coveted item they own.

**`hottestShoeOffers` Variant:**
```sql
-- The '7' can be replaced with a dynamic parameter
WITH OfferCounts AS (
  SELECT
    oi.product_variant_id,
    COUNT(o.id) AS offer_count
  FROM offers o
  JOIN offer_items oi ON o.id = oi.offer_id
  WHERE o.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' AND o.offer_status = 'OPEN'
  GROUP BY oi.product_variant_id
),
UserInventory AS (
  SELECT
    inv.user_id,
    inv.product_variant_id
  FROM inventory_items inv
  WHERE inv.user_id = ANY(%s::uuid[]) AND inv.status = 'OPEN_FOR_TRADE' AND inv.deleted_at = 0
),
RankedInventory AS (
  SELECT
    ui.user_id,
    ui.product_variant_id,
    oc.offer_count,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ui.user_id ORDER BY oc.offer_count DESC, ui.product_variant_id) as rn
  FROM UserInventory ui
  JOIN OfferCounts oc ON ui.product_variant_id = oc.product_variant_id
)
SELECT
  ri.user_id,
  p.name as hottest_shoe_offers_name,
  pv.id::text as hottest_shoe_offers_variantid,
  ri.offer_count as hottest_shoe_offers_count
FROM RankedInventory ri
JOIN product_variants pv ON ri.product_variant_id = pv.id
JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE ri.rn = 1
```

**`hottestShoeTraded` Variant:**
```sql
-- The '30' can be replaced with a dynamic parameter
WITH TradeCounts AS (
  SELECT
    oi.product_variant_id,
    COUNT(t.id) AS trade_count
  FROM trades t
  JOIN offers o ON t.offer_id = o.id
  JOIN offer_items oi ON o.id = oi.offer_id
  WHERE t.validation_passed_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY oi.product_variant_id
),
UserInventory AS (
  SELECT
    inv.user_id,
    inv.product_variant_id
  FROM inventory_items inv
  WHERE inv.user_id = ANY(%s::uuid[]) AND inv.status = 'OPEN_FOR_TRADE' AND inv.deleted_at = 0
),
RankedInventory AS (
  SELECT
    ui.user_id,
    ui.product_variant_id,
    tc.trade_count,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ui.user_id ORDER BY tc.trade_count DESC, ui.product_variant_id) as rn
  FROM UserInventory ui
  JOIN TradeCounts tc ON ui.product_variant_id = tc.product_variant_id
)
SELECT
  ri.user_id,
  p.name as hottest_shoe_traded_name,
  pv.id::text as hottest_shoe_traded_variantid,
  ri.trade_count as hottest_shoe_traded_count
FROM RankedInventory ri
JOIN product_variants pv ON ri.product_variant_id = pv.id
JOIN products p ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE ri.rn = 1
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Two-Stage Logic**: Pre-aggregates global demand stats (`OfferCounts`, `TradeCounts`) before joining with user-specific data (`UserInventory`). This is highly performant.
- **Global vs. Local**: Correctly measures the global "hotness" of an item, not the user's personal activity for it.
- **Configurable Lookback**: Uses parameterized time windows (e.g., '7 days' for offers, '30 days' for trades) to define "recent" activity.
- **Focus on Actionable Inventory**: Filters for items that are actually available for trade (`status = 'OPEN_FOR_TRADE'`).

## Usage Guidelines

### Performance Considerations:

- Use `ANY(%(user_ids)s::uuid[])` for efficient bulk user queries
- Consider indexes on frequently filtered fields (`deleted_at`, `created_at`, `validation_passed_date`)
- ROW_NUMBER() window functions are generally more efficient than GROUP BY + MAX patterns
- LEFT JOINs preserve all users even when related data is missing
- Pre-build lookup structures for size-based matching to avoid nested loops
- Use CTEs to break complex queries into readable, optimizable chunks

### Extensibility:

Each pattern can be modified by:
- Changing time windows (90 days → 30 days, etc.)
- Adding additional filters (product categories, price ranges, etc.)
- Modifying ranking criteria (recency vs. frequency vs. engagement)
- Combining multiple patterns for complex audience definitions
- Adjusting engagement thresholds for different campaign types
- Adding new product statistics or user metrics as needed 

### 1. **User Activity & Status**
*Find users based on their recent activity or status attributes.*

**Active within the last X days:**
```sql
-- Select users active in the last 30 days
SELECT u.id, u.username, ua.last_active
FROM users u
JOIN user_activities ua ON u.id = ua.user_id
WHERE ua.last_active >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

**NOT active within the last X days (Dormant Users):**
```sql
-- Select users who have not been active in the last 90 days
SELECT u.id, u.username, ua.last_active
FROM users u
JOIN user_activities ua ON u.id = ua.user_id
WHERE ua.last_active < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

**Trusted Traders:**
```sql
-- Select all users who are marked as trusted traders
SELECT u.id, u.username
FROM users u
WHERE u.is_trusted_trader = TRUE;
```

---

## Batch Mutation Patterns

### 23. **Batch Variant Price Updates**
*Update min/max market prices for multiple product variants based on size-specific pricing data*

This pattern enables efficient bulk price updates by working at the product level - you provide a product ID and size-based pricing, and the system handles variant identification and batch updates.

**Core Query - Get Product Variants by Size:**
```sql
query GetProductVariants($productId: uuid!) {
    product_variants(where: {product_id: {_eq: $productId}}) {
        id
        product_id
        index_cache
        min_market_price
        max_market_price
    }
}
```

**Batch Update Mutation Pattern:**
```graphql
mutation UpdateVariantPrices($variantId: uuid!, $minPrice: String!, $maxPrice: String!) {
    update_product_variants(
        where: {id: {_eq: $variantId}},
        _set: {
            min_market_price: $minPrice,
            max_market_price: $maxPrice
        }
    ) {
        affected_rows
        returning {
            id
            min_market_price
            max_market_price
        }
    }
}
```

**Verification Query Pattern:**
```sql
query VerifyUpdates($variantIds: [uuid!]!) {
    product_variants(where: {id: {_in: $variantIds}}) {
        id
        index_cache
        min_market_price
        max_market_price
    }
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Size Extraction**: Uses `index_cache->>'mens_size'` to map sizes to variant IDs
- **Error Handling**: Validates data at each step (variant lookup, size matching, price validation)
- **Batch Processing**: Executes individual mutations sequentially for better error isolation
- **Verification**: Re-queries updated variants to confirm changes applied correctly
- **Input Flexibility**: Supports CSV, JSON, or programmatic data input

**Key Insights:**
- Product-centric approach is more intuitive than variant-centric for price management
- Size-based mapping enables natural workflow (think in sizes, not UUIDs)
- Individual mutations provide better error granularity than single bulk mutation
- Verification step catches edge cases where mutations succeed but changes don't persist
- Pattern is extensible to other variant-level bulk updates (stock levels, availability, etc.)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Pre-loads all variants for a product to avoid N+1 queries during size matching
- Uses sequential mutations rather than parallel to avoid overwhelming the GraphQL endpoint

### 23. **Time Window User Activity with Cooling Period**
*OPTIMIZED pattern for intelligent time-based user activity filtering*

**Use Case:** Perfect for follow-up notifications where you want to target users who took specific actions in the past, but avoid sending immediate follow-ups. For example, Layer 3 push notifications targeting users who added items 48-12 hours ago.

**Why This Pattern is Superior:**
This replaces simple "last N hours" queries with UX-aware time windows that prevent notification fatigue and improve user experience by respecting natural response times.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Layer 3 push notifications (48-12 hours ago)
activity_data = get_time_window_activity_data(lookback_hours=48, cooling_hours=12)

# Original behavior (0-24 hours ago) 
activity_data = get_time_window_activity_data(lookback_hours=24, cooling_hours=0)
```

**SQL Pattern:**
```sql
WITH time_boundaries AS (
    SELECT 
        NOW() - INTERVAL '%(cooling_hours)s hours' as recent_cutoff,
        NOW() - INTERVAL '%(lookback_hours)s hours' as lookback_cutoff
),
activity_in_window AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        action_type,
        product_name,
        variant_id,
        created_at
    FROM user_actions ua
    CROSS JOIN time_boundaries tb
    WHERE ua.created_at >= tb.lookback_cutoff 
    AND ua.created_at <= tb.recent_cutoff
    AND ua.status = 'ACTIVE'
)
SELECT * FROM activity_in_window ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Time Window Logic**: Uses `>=` lookback and `<=` recent cutoff to create precise time windows
- **UX Optimization**: Cooling period prevents immediate follow-ups (better than simple lookback)
- **Flexible Parameters**: Both lookback and cooling periods are configurable for different use cases
- **Performance**: Single query with clear time boundaries is more efficient than complex date arithmetic
- **Index Utilization**: Time range queries work well with created_at indexes

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Layer 3 Push Notifications**: Target users 48-12 hours after actions (prevents immediate follow-ups)
- **Email Sequences**: Send follow-up emails with appropriate delays
- **Re-engagement Campaigns**: Target users who were active 7-3 days ago
- **Abandoned Cart**: Target users who added items 24-2 hours ago (gives time to complete purchase)

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Uses `time_boundaries` CTE to calculate times once rather than in each subquery
- `CROSS JOIN time_boundaries` pattern is more efficient than repeated date calculations
- Works well with standard `created_at` indexes on activity tables
- Batches verification into single query for efficiency
